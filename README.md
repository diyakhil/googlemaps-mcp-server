# 🚗 Driver Assistant App

A smart, voice-powered assistant for drivers to field simple questions while driving. This MVP utilizes speech-to-text transcription through Open AI's Whisper 
and dynamic query resolution through a custom MCP server with tools leveraging Google Maps APIs and web fallback through Open Search. The assistant recites back 
responses to the driver using Google's text-to-speech (TTS).
